## Documentation Philosophy

GeoExhibit documentation follows these principles:

1. **User-first**: Main README prioritizes user getting started quickly
2. **Context-rich**: Agent documentation provides complete technical picture
3. **Decision-driven**: Major architectural choices are documented with rationale
4. **Example-driven**: Working examples demonstrate concepts better than descriptions
5. **Maintenance-focused**: Documentation structure supports easy updates and additions
