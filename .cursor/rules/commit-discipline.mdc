# Commit Discipline

- Conventional commits (no noise): short, task-level titles; concise bodies.
  Examples: feat: add analyzer protocol, feat: implement stac writer item builder, fix: s3 key generation, test: publisher happy path.
  Disallow: "final test…", "WIP…", running todo references, ALL-CAPS emphasis, emojis in titles.
- Commit discipline: one unit of code with its matching test per commit; push frequently.
- Run linters before commit: ALWAYS run black, ruff, mypy locally before committing to catch issues early.
- Check CI gate every 4 commits: Use GitHub API to verify CI status and address failures immediately.
- Minimalism: prefer less and simpler code; add third-party libs only when they clearly reduce LOC and simplify UX.
