# CI Gate Rule

- GitHub Actions CI gate: use ruff for linting, black for formatting, pytest for testing, mypy --strict for type checking. 
- Agent must use GitHub REST/GraphQL API to check latest workflow run; if CI fails, stop, fetch failing job logs, and surface brief diagnosis before any fixes.
- Badges: add build, coverage, and lint badges to README.
