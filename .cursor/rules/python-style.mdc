# Python Standards

- Python â‰¥ 3.11, type hints everywhere; mypy --strict passes.
- Style: black for formatting, ruff for linting (including import rules).
- Comments are a code smell: code should be self-documenting through clear naming, good structure, and well-designed interfaces. Only add comments where there is unexpected code that is unavoidable or where there is complexity/decisions that need explanation. Minimal docstrings remain pythonic and acceptable.
- Tests: pytest, deterministic, I/O isolated with fakes/mocks.
- Structure: small modules; pure core; dependency injection for side effects (S3, FS, network).
- Logging: stdlib logging; JSON logs (machine-friendly) with helpful fields.
- Errors: fail fast; precise exception messages.
- Docs: module/public API docstrings; examples in README and --help.
