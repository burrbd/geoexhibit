# GeoExhibit Technical Debt Analysis

This document identifies technical debt items found during Issue #18 repository cleanup.

## ‚úÖ Items Addressed in Issue #18

### Files Removed
- `awscliv2.zip` - Leftover AWS CLI installation artifact
- `ci_gate.py` - Unused CI gate script (functionality moved to pre-commit hooks)
- `examples/` - Empty directory after consolidation to `demo/`
- `debug_output/` - Stale job outputs from development
- `terraform/steel-thread-test.py` - Duplicate of `demo/steel_thread_test.py`
- `geoexhibit.egg-info/` - Build artifacts
- `geoexhibit/__pycache__/` - Python cache files

### Repository Organization Improvements
- ‚úÖ **Demo consolidation**: All demo files moved to `demo/` directory
- ‚úÖ **Agent documentation**: All agent-related docs moved to `docs/agent-context/`
- ‚úÖ **Path updates**: Updated all references to moved files
- ‚úÖ **README enhancement**: Added complete setup instructions with infrastructure deployment

## üîç Additional Technical Debt Items

### Code Quality & Testing
1. **Test coverage gaps**: While overall coverage is 96%+, some edge cases could be better covered:
   - Error handling in CLI when features file is malformed
   - S3Publisher edge cases (network failures, permission errors)
   - DemoAnalyzer boundary conditions

2. **Type hints**: Some functions could benefit from more specific type hints:
   - `geoexhibit/pipeline.py` - Some return types could be more specific
   - `geoexhibit/orchestrator.py` - Complex nested types could be clarified

### Configuration & Dependencies
3. **Hardcoded values**: Some values that could be configurable:
   - PMTiles zoom levels (currently hardcoded in config)
   - Retry counts for AWS operations
   - COG tile sizes and compression settings

4. **Optional dependencies**: Better handling of optional dependencies:
   - tippecanoe detection could be more robust
   - AWS CLI dependency check in terraform setup

### Documentation & UX
5. **Error messages**: Some error messages could be more helpful:
   - AWS credential errors could suggest specific fixes
   - Configuration validation could point to specific fields
   - Feature loading errors could suggest format fixes

6. **CLI improvements**: Potential UX enhancements:
   - Progress bars for long operations (COG generation, S3 upload)
   - Better dry-run output format
   - Configuration validation command

### Infrastructure & Deployment
7. **Terraform state management**: No guidance for remote state storage
8. **Security**: Some improvements possible:
   - More restrictive IAM policies for Lambda
   - CORS configuration could be more specific
   - S3 bucket policies could be tightened

### Performance & Scalability
9. **Memory usage**: Large COG generation could benefit from streaming
10. **Parallel processing**: Feature analysis could be parallelized
11. **Caching**: TiTiler responses could benefit from better cache headers

## üöÄ Future Improvement Priorities

### High Priority
1. Improve error messages and CLI UX
2. Add configuration validation command
3. Better handling of optional dependencies

### Medium Priority
1. Add progress bars for long operations
2. Implement parallel feature processing
3. Improve test coverage for edge cases

### Low Priority
1. Add configuration options for hardcoded values
2. Implement streaming for large COG operations
3. Optimize memory usage patterns

## üìã Implementation Guidelines

When addressing these items:

1. **Follow project rules**: Maintain commit discipline, one unit + test per commit
2. **Update documentation**: Add decisions to `docs/agent-context/DECISIONS.md`
3. **Maintain coverage**: Keep test coverage ‚â•95%
4. **Consider minimalism**: Only add complexity that clearly improves UX or reduces LOC

## üîó Related Issues

Future GitHub issues should be created for:
- Performance optimization (parallel processing)
- CLI UX improvements (progress bars, better errors)
- Infrastructure hardening (security, state management)

This analysis follows GeoExhibit's principle of continuous improvement while maintaining the project's minimalist philosophy.
